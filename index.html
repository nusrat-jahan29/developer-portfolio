            <h3>Elsa's Life History</h3>
            <p>From the outside, Elsa looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality, she lives in fear as she
                wrestles with a mighty secret—she was born with the power to create ice and snow. It's a beautiful
                ability, but also extremely dangerous.</p>

            <p>However, when given a chance to rest and relent, Elsa's true, warm, kind, fun-loving, and innocently
                mischievous personality came about - but only briefly and with restriction, as seen on the night of her
                coronation. Elsa also has a generous disposition that contributes to her compassion towards her people

                <p>Elsa can create, shape, and manipulate ice, water frozen into a solid state. As an elemental power,
                    cryokinesis has a nigh-limitless number of uses, only limited by the imagination and natural limits.

                <p>Elsa can create,shape and manipulate snow, precipitation in the form of flakes of crystalline water
                    ice.
                    Because snow is composed of small ice particles, it is a granular material with an open and
                    therefore
                    soft structure, unless subjected to external pressure.</p>
